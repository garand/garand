# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000 with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm start` - Start the production server

## Architecture

This is a personal portfolio website built with:

- **Framework**: TanStack Start (React-based full-stack framework)
- **Router**: TanStack Router with file-based routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with dark mode support
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fast compilation
- **TypeScript**: Configured with modern ES2022 target

### Key Components

- **Router Configuration**: `src/router.tsx` - Sets up TanStack Router with custom NotFound component
- **Root Route**: `src/routes/__root.tsx` - Defines the HTML document structure, meta tags, and global layout
- **Index Route**: `src/routes/index.tsx` - Main portfolio page with personal information, work history, and past projects
- **Route Tree**: `src/routeTree.gen.ts` - Auto-generated route tree (do not edit manually)

### Styling Architecture

- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with the new Vite plugin
- Dark mode implemented with `dark:` prefixes
- Responsive design with `sm:`, `md:` breakpoints
- CSS Grid used extensively for complex layouts
- Prettier configured with Tailwind CSS plugin for class sorting

### Development Notes

- TypeScript configuration is minimal but includes strict null checks
- Vite development server allows external hosts (useful for testing on different devices)
- Uses SWC for React compilation for better performance
- Route tree is auto-generated by TanStack Router
